# Topic 5.1: Persistence Layer

## Reading
In order to create our persistence layer is important to introduce a new concept: Java Persistence
API (JPA). JPA is a java specification for mapping Java objects to the tables of relational
databases. JPA is just a specification and it can't perform persistence or anything else by itself.
JPA is only a set of interfaces and requires an implementation. Implementations of this
specification don't only handle the code to interacts with the database, but also map the data to
objects structures used by the application. You can go further following this link:

+ [spring-boot-hibernate](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-hibernate)
+ [H2 Quick Start](https://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html)

## Practice
This topic is all about persistence, so you need to do the following tasks:
+ Create the .sql file for the different models that you created in the topic 5
+ Create persistence layer using Spring Data JPA
